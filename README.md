PSA 4: Inheritance and Critter Simulation

Prepare for battle. Write several lineages of Critters and test your gameplay strategy by designing your own Critter for combat. The rules are generally simple, but there are some nuances to the rules. Your strategies can be highly complex. You will learn both a new object-oriented design paradigm using inheritance as well as entering challenges against both our provided and your classmates‚Äô Critters.

Critter competition with your classmates to see whose Critter will come out the strongest and luckiest.

The top 3 winners from each section of the competition will receive a 3D printed sculpture of an animal. Below are some of the critters you could win:

For this assignment, w e will not purposefully test edge cases, but the program (simulation) must still run without crashing. The program IS the simulation! If your Critter works for the program on your computer, it will work for ours.

Submission and Grading

Part 1: .vimrc [5 Points]

If you have not created a custom configuration for Vim yet, here is your chance to make Vim a little more friendly. If you have already created a vimrc file in the past, you‚Äôre already good to go. Submit that vimrc. In the file header, comment whether you made this before or made this for the assignment.

In your home directory (~), make a file called . vimrc with the dot in front. The file must do at least:

1. Make Vim use a different color scheme from the default. Pick your favorite theme. Past favorites are desert and elflord.

2. Always show the line numbers in any file opened in vim.

3. Insert 4 spaces instead of a tab when you press the tab key (it is n ot enough to simply set the width of each tab to 4 ‚Äì they must be actual spaces, not tabs).

The Arena

Movement

On each round of the simulation, the simulator asks each Critter object which direction it wants to move by calling its getMove method. Each round a Critter can move one square north, south, east, west, OR stay at its current location (i.e. center). The world has a finite size, but it wraps around in all four directions (for example, moving east from the right edge brings you back to the left edge). I t might be tempting to allow your critters to make several moves at once using a loop, but you can‚Äôt. The only way a critter moves is to wait for the simulator to ask it for a single move and return that move. Fighting

The following table summarizes the choices and which animal will win in each case. To remember which beats which, notice that the starting letters of ‚ÄúRoar, Pounce, Scratch‚Äù match those of ‚ÄúRock, Paper, Scissors.‚Äù If the animals make the same choice, the winner is chosen with a coin flip.

The relationship of different attack actions are listed in the following table.

Critter #2

ROAR POUNCE SCRATCH FORFEIT

ROAR random (50% chance) #2 #1 #1

POUNCE #1 random (50% chance) #2 #1

SCRATCH #2 #1 random (50% chance) #1

FORFEIT #2 #2 #2 random (50% chance)

Critter #1 Mating

If two animals of the same species collide, they ‚Äúmate‚Äù to produce a baby. Animals are vulnerable to attack while mating: any other animal that collides with them will defeat them. An animal can mate only once during its lifetime. The ‚Äúbaby‚Äù will be a full adult by birth and will spawn next to the parent critters when they finish mating.

Eating

Scoring

The simulator keeps a score for each class of animal, shown on the right side of the screen. A class‚Äôs score is based on how many animals of that class are alive, how much food they have eaten, and how many other animals they have defeated.

The Assignment

There is a UML diagram of the Critter family tree at the beginning of Part 1. In this diagram, we tell you in addition to what bloodline that the Critters have, which classes are provided, which classes you do not need to edit, and which classes require you to write the file from scratch.

Just by defining a class to ‚Äúextends Critter‚Äù, you receive a default version of the methods defined in Critters.java. Look inside the file to see what the default behaviors are for each of the following methods: eat, fight, getColor, getMove, and toString. If you don‚Äôt want this default behavior, you will then override the inherited methods in your class through your own definition of the method. The method will have the exact same signature and return type, but your own implementation will be used over the inherited one. Here is an example of a class that inherits from Critter:

import java.awt.*; public class Stone extends Critter {

@Override /* You MUST use @Override for every method you override. We require it because it introduces you to using annotations and ensures that you will correctly override methods! */

public Attack fight (String opponent) { return Attack.ROAR;

}

@Override public Color getColor () { return Color.GRAY;

}

@Override public String toString() { return ‚ÄúS‚Äù;

}

}

Running the Simulator

The steps to getting the simulator running are slightly longer than 2048‚Äôs steps. First, compile all necessary classes. You can compile separately if needed, but j avac *.java is most convenient. Next, run the simulator with java CritterMain. The following screen will appear. Enabling‚ÄùDebug output‚Äù will print the actions your critters take to the terminal. You can also choose the size and amount of critters that initially appear in the world, and select which critters that will start in the world.

You have many options in the next screen. You can adjust the speed of the simulator. When you press Go, the simulation will take off and run. You can Stop the simulation. For visual testing, you can click Tick, which will run one round of the simulation. If you would like to toggle debug messages on your terminal as your simulation runs, click the check box for ‚ÄúDebug‚Äù.

Part 2: Getting to Know the Critter Family [10 Points]

This portion introduces you to writing classes with inheritance. If you have not read the Critter.java file, do so now. Critter is the abstract class from which all subclasses will be derived, directly or indirectly. This file will also contain enums that are important for you to use in the following tasks. There are five classes in total you will work on, hence there will be five classes you will write with style. See the UML diagram below for a graph of the family. Note: the instance variables are not listed. You can have additional instance variables if needed for all the class that you implement.

Inheriting from Critter

Next, take a look at HappyAnimal.java, which is a provided class that you do not need to edit. Its functions are incomplete though. So what would happen if you instantiated HappyAnimals on the simulation? Try it now by compiling and run the simulation on HappyAnimal. You don‚Äôt have to modify the HappyAnimals class for this PSA.

By writing a HappyAnimal class, we can define a subset of Critters that are ‚Äúhappy‚Äù. The subclasses of HappyAnimal will inherit its characteristics, and you will have the choice of overriding any of those characteristics.

Your task is to implement a class that is parallel to the HappyAnimal: the SadAnimal class (SadAnimal.java in the starter code). SadAnimal is a partially implemented Critter whose behavior can be seen in the simulation as incomplete. Notice that there is already a provided class that extends SadAnimal ‚Äì the Omnivore. The methods you write in SadAnimal will not only be affecting SadAnimal.java, but also all subclasses that choose to extends SadAnimal but chooses to not override the methods. Because of this, writing code for SadAnimal is very important to get right. The definition will affect many other classes!

SadAnimal class

‚óè Instance variables: T he SadAnimal knows the following things: a String that it will use to identify itself, a Color it will display itself with, a boolean to know whether it has eaten yet, a Random object when it needs to be able to make arbitrary decisions or some other purpose, and an int by which the SadAnimal or its descendants will count. A ll these fields should be protected. You can have more instance variables if you think they are necessary.

‚óè No-arg constructor: Instantiate all instance variables except the Random and count variables. You will notice that SadAnimal in particular did not have a use for Random or count but its subclasses might. The boolean indicator variable should be initialized as false, the color should be red, and the name of the SadAnimal is the three character String: ‚Äú:-(‚Äù.

‚óè Override getMove method: SadAnimal has the ability to move but it is only able to alternate between moving south, or west. By default, it will always move west first, and then when it eats, it changes direction to south. When it eats again, it will go west, and the pattern continues. If the World runs out of food, it‚Äôs stuck going in one direction!

‚óè Override eat method: When presented with food, SadAnimal will always eat.

‚óè Override getColor method: Return the color field. Don‚Äôt return red directly as a hard-coded color. Make sure you return the field.

‚óè Override toString method: Return the string field. Similarly like the getColor method, don‚Äôt return the hardcoded name. Return the correct field.

Inheriting from Classes that Inherited from Critter

Now that you have finished implementing SadAnimal, we will move one level lower. The Sloth is a fully implemented animal! B e careful though, that does not mean that Sloth overrides all the methods it inherited from HappyAnimal; it means simply that all the functions will have some kind of implementation, simple or hard, and inherited or overridden. Also, remember that the Sloth inherits instance variables from its superclasses too.

Sloth class

‚óè Instance Variables: Specific to the Sloth, it is very important to remember whether it has eaten previously, and whether it moved north. Y ou should design how many instance variables you need and their types. The goal is to make sure your methods work correctly with the help from these instance variables. All instance variables should be protected.

‚óè Constructor: U pon birth, Sloths are named ‚ÄúS‚Äù, know that they have not yet eaten previously, and intuitively decide to move north first.

‚óè Override eat method: Sloth loves to eat. When encountering food, the Sloth will always eat. A sloth should keep track of the number of times it has eaten, because it will use this to determine what attack it is going to use.

‚óè Override fight method: In general, a sloth will scratch in self defense if it encounters another critter. However, some sloths have grown large enough to pounce instead. If a sloth has eaten 10 food or more, then it will pounce instead.

‚óè Override getMove method: The Sloth will alternate in moving north and east, starting with north when it is first born.

‚óè Override sleep and wakeup methods: Sloth‚Äôs identity is an ‚ÄúS‚Äù whenever it wakes up, but whenever it sleeps, it will appear to other Critters as ‚ÄúZzz‚Äù.

Now, let‚Äôs look at the Omnivore, which extends from SadAnimal that you implemented. Notice that this is not a particular animal! Although the Sloth is a fully implemented animal inherited from HappyAnimal, we do not necessarily need to have the same rate of implementation completeness going down the inheritance family. We fully implemented Sloth extending from HappyAnimal because w e could. But we can also implement a slightly complete, but not fully complete, animal from SadAnimal, because w e

can.

Part 3: Completing the Critter Family [40 Points]

This part continues directly from Part 2. In this section, you will define Critter classes from scratch, and then override certain methods inherited from Critter, SadAnimal, and Omnivore. In addition, there will be certain new methods that will be implemented as part of the three classes you will implement. There will be two lineages that inherit from the Omnivore: Turtle and GreenTurtle, and Leopard.

Let‚Äôs implement the Leopard first. The Leopard is the last subclass in its lineage, which goes Critter ‚Üí SadAnimal ‚Üí Omnivore ‚Üí Leopard. The Leopard inherits from Omnivore, which is a provided file, but has inherited some fields from SadAnimal which you implemented. So, while some fields inherited from Omnivore were inherited directly, others were inherited from SadAnimal. The Leopard has one unique instance variable that needs to be implemented, which results in a more unique behavior for eat and fight.

Leopard Class

‚óè Instance variables: Each Leopard, in addition to the instance variables inherited from its superclasses, will all telepathically keep track of their confidence together. The confidence starts at 10 when the simulation starts. When the confidence of one Leopard is affected, All Leopard‚Äôs confidence will be affected in the exact same way. (Hint: What type of modifier can you apply to a variable to make that variable shared across all instances?)

‚óè Override win and lose method: If a Leopard wins a fight, all Leopards‚Äô confidence will increment if their confidence is less than 10. If a Leopard loses, all Leopards will reduce their confidence by 1 if their confidence is greater than zero. The minimum confidence they have is 0, and the maximum is 10. (Think: where do these two methods come from?)

‚óè Override getMove method: The Leopard will move south five times, west five times, north five times, and east five times, prowling around this square motion for the remainder of its life. Leopard remembers this by using its inherited memory to incrementally count.

‚óè Override eat method: The Leopards will always have (confidence * 10)% chance of eating. If confidence is at 2, then there is a 20% chance of eating.

‚óè Override fight method: When fighting, if the opponent is the Omnivore class (NOT a subclass of Omnivore) OR when all Leopards have a confidence HIGHER than 5, then the Leopard will roar.

Else if all the Leopards have a confidence less than 2, they are too scared to attack and forfeit. Otherwise the Leopard will scratch.

The Turtle starts a lineage that diverges from Leopard. T he Turtle extends from Omnivore and is in general slow and indecisive. The Turtle often likes to think about what attack it will use, and so it makes a decision after a fight and when it encounters food. Turtles are able to walk in one directly only, and gets tired easily so it always waits two times before moving again. The Turtle is thoughtful, but slow and indecisive.

Turtle Class

‚óè No-arg constructor: Self-identifies as ‚ÄúTu‚Äù and is color cyan. Initialize count to the value you choose, and the random will instantiate with a seed of 8.

‚óè New method to decide attack ‚Äì generateAttack(): Turtle will often think about what attack it wants to use next, and this method sets the attack mode of turtle (i.e. change the attack field of Turtle). When the Turtle chooses a move, it will cycle between roar, scratch and pounce, in that order. For example, the first time that generateAttack() is called, the Turtle will decide to use roar on its first attack. The second time, scratch, and the third, pounce, and then it repeats. The Turtle will decide its attack mode in two different scenarios (i.e. call this generateAttack method): (1) when it wins a fight and (2) when it encounters food. The thought process is the same in all of these actions. Be careful with this description, as it affects more than one method.

‚óè Override getMove() method: Turtle will stand still two times, and then move north, repeating this pattern for the duration of the simulation. You can use the inherited count variable to keep track of the pattern.

‚óè Override fight() method: The Turtle will always use the attack that it has decided on using. Simply return the attack field.

‚óè Override win() method: Upon winning a fight, Turtle decides a new attack.

‚óè Override eat() method: The Turtle will never eat, but upon encountering food, the Turtle decides a new attack.

Next, the G reenTurtle, which should extends from Turtle. G reenTurtle is even more thoughtful than

Turtle. It not only thinks about what attack is should do next, but also which direction to move. GreenTurtle always moves in some direction, and is decisive on what attack it should do. GreenTurtle goes through various thoughts upon doing various actions as described below. In short, although GreenTurtle is indecisive about which direction to move, it is decisive on its attack, fast, and versatile. GreenTurtle Class

‚óè Instance Variables: should remember the next intended Direction to take. You can design any other fields that deem appropriate. (Think: Why did we intentionally leave out the information that GreenTurtle should be able to remember what attack it wants to use? )

‚óè No-arg constructor: self-identity is ‚ÄúG‚Äù and is green. Random seed is 9. Right after it is born, it has a natural sense of direction to know it should go north first. It will be able to start counting from a value you set. (Where did the count instance variable come from?) It will also make the initial choice to roar.

‚óè New method to deciding the move ‚Äì generateMove(): the GreenTurtle will cycle between the four non-center directions, starting with north, then south, then east, then west. It will go through this thought process (i.e. call the generateMove method) if it wins a fight, a nd when it eats. Since the GreenTurtle eats only three times, there will be only three times when GreenTurtle thinks of its next move while eating. This method shouldn‚Äôt take any parameters.

‚óè Override generateAttack() method: The GreenTurtle will go through the thought process of choosing its next Attack when it mates, and when it wins a fight. When it chooses a new Attack, GreenTurtle will alternate between roaring and scratching.

‚óè Override eat() method: GreenTurtle will eat three times and then never eats again. This means that there is only three times where encountering food will cause the GreenTurtle decide its next direction. You should use the inherited count variable to keep track of it.

‚óè Override fight() method: If the opponent the GreenTurtle is facing is Sloth, the GreenTurtle will roar. BUT, if the Sloth is sleeping, then the GreenTurtle will forfeit. Otherwise, the GreenTurtle will use the attack that it had decided on earlier.

‚óè Override win() method: Upon winning, the GreenTurtle will decide its next direction and its next attack.

‚óè Override mate() method: Upon mating, the GreenTurtle will decide its next attack.

‚óè Override getMove() method: The GreenTurtle will move in the direction that it has decided on.

In the E lephant class, which should extend HappyAnimal, all elephants will try to travel together in a herd. Additionally, elephants engage on long treks to reach locations they have going to. All elephants have a common location that they all travel towards at once, in order to eventually meet up.

Elephant Class

‚óè Instance Variables: Elephants have an x and y goal to which they all travel towards in a pack. This goal is for all elephants (think: what modifier should be applied to these variables). At the beginning you should mark, in some way, that these have not yet been set. I mportant: in order for us to grade the behavior of the Elephant class, it is required that these variables be named goalX and g oalY. If you give these variables a different name, we m ay be unable to grade your Elephant class.

‚óè No-arg constructor: The elephants self-identity is ‚ÄúEl‚Äù and it is colored gray. Notice that Elephant inherited the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù reference variable from HappyAnimal. Elephant will instantiate a new Random with the seed 2048, and assign this new instance to that inherited reference variable.

‚óè Override fight() method: Elephants should always pounce.

‚óè Override getMove() method: When move() is called, the Elephant will check if it has reached the goal location it wanted to reach. If it has, or the goal has not been set for the first time, set a new goal as a random location in the simulation (Hint: the method getHeight() and getWidth() in the Critter class will give you the size of the similuation). This new goal applies for a ll elephants. When the Elephant moves, it should always move in a direction towards its goal. If it is further away in the x direction, it should move east or west towards its goal. If the elephant is further away in the y direction, it should move north or south.

Part 4: Inheritance Concepts [10 Points]

This part requires that the previous two parts are implemented and correct to our specification. In README.md, for each of the following questions, provide information about what happened, why you think that is happening, and use the concept of inheritance to support your answer.

You should create a new class file that will not be submitted for the sole purpose of having a main method defined in a class outside the Critter family. Declare and instantiate various Critters inside this new main method, and then try to find out as much as possible, based on your understanding of inheritance, for each of the questions. Each answer must be at least four sentences long, and at most six sentences long.

1. Suppose in the Critter.java file, I add an additional method. It is defined with the following pseudocode: method sayStuff():

System.out.println(‚ÄúI am a Critter.‚Äù);

How does that affect other Critters?

2. What is the fight behavior of SadAnimal? Explain why it is the case.

3. Suppose that I comment out getColor in HappyAnimal.java. What happens? Why does it happen?

4. In SadAnimal.java, suppose I add one more instance variable that is a public and static String. Who is affected, and what happened? Please also clearly explain why. Experiment (change it, add it, bop it) with this variable in your subclasses.

Part 5: Your Critter [10 Points]

You critter must, at a minimum, have its own display name and color choice, and override the g etMove() and f ight() methods to receive full credit for this part. You should aim to make it as strong as possible. Be sure to test out your critter‚Äôs strength with various critter combinations that you implemented from the previous parts.

Part 5.1 Well-Adapted Critters [10 Extra Credit]

At this point, you have implemented Critters to our specification with our guidance in starter code, other Critters with hints from the writeup, and your own Critter you added to the Critter family. For the extra credit, your critter needs to be able to win against some more difficult critters that are adapted to their environments.

The conditions for a ‚Äúwin‚Äù is the following:

1. The screen size is width = 60 and height = 50. There will be CritterCount = 25 of each Critter.

2. At 1000 moves, the game is considered over. Even though the game will continue to run, we specify that 1000 moves is the minimum time of the simulation.

3. Your Critter must have the highest score and least one of your Critters must still be alive in the World.

Two out of three simulation executions done by the grader must result in a Win for your Critter for full credit. Any less will be considered for partial credit based on the performance as seen by the simulator.

Your Critter must win in the following environments:

1. A World with Sloths, Leopards, Turtles, GreenTurtles, Elephants and Mystery. [2 Points]

2. A World with Sloths, Leopards, Turtles, GreenTurtles, Elephants and Raccoons. [8 Points]

Only the class file of Mystery and Raccoons are provided. There will be no documentation about these classes. To find out what is the functionalities of this class, run them in the simulator and observe their behavior with other classes, including your own class. Use the Tick button if you like.

Part 6: Program Descriptions [5 Points]

Write a paragraph on how you tested your Critters. Examples of your testing procedures might include what features of the Critter simulation you used to help you run your tests.

Write a paragraph about the entire Critters program itself. This program description should NOT be about each class related to the Critters. That‚Äôs the file and class headers‚Äô job. Rather, the description should talk about what the simulator does, how the simulator reads files into its program, and how you change the settings to your needs.
